We want to make workflows in pharma more efficient, empowering medical, regulatory and commercial teams in their workflows and ultimately helping patients worldwide.<br><br>Today\u2019s macroeconomic trends, such as rising cost and declining ROI in drug development paired with changes in global health regulation amplify the pressure on the pharmaceutical industry. They need to actively manage their product portfolio, however, data is often isolated in silos, making cross-functional collaboration and decision making tedious and complicated.<br><br>Due to complex product portfolios and a constantly updating scientific landscape, most analysis must be manually compiled and the majority time of is spent on data aggregation and processing and limited time on execution. This can lead to patient care gaps fuelled through slow market adaptation (e.g., missing medications through stock-outs), unrealized added value for pharmaceutical companies due to missed opportunities and inefficient resource management (e.g., missed tenders etc.) and accelerated health care cost through delayed or missing patient care options (e.g., missing products in the market).<br><br>Our solutions help multidisciplinary teams effectively manage their product portfolios, accelerate management of medical inquiries, literature research and scientific writing and help to navigate global and local fragmented regulations and stay compliant.<br><br>With AVAYL\u2019s solutions, pharmaceutical companies can stay up to date on their competitive landscape and relevant market changes, such as termination or launches of products, stockouts or price changes. Across teams and departments, they can use our software to speed up scientific research and writing as well as working with regulatory information across the globe. For example, when managing stockouts, AVAYL ensures through tracking of all competitor stock-outs that portfolio managers and supply chain planners are informed on time and immediate supply chain actions can be taken to ensure availability of medicine at patient level.<br><br>We monitor the pharmaceutical market in real-time, with more than one million market changes monitored daily for over one million medicines world-wide and over 200 Million million medical studies connected to our system. This ensures that our users always have access to the most relevant data in-time and can take immediate actions.<br><br>So far, we have built our software-as-a-service with more than five pharmaceutical companies as our initial customers and have secured the backing of 30+ business angels and investors to build our platform. We address a global and growing market of intelligence services in the pharmaceutical industry where we compete against traditional data providers, who offer access to data but do not help the user to identify meaningful actions and execute on it.<br><br>We are a small but fast growing team of pharmaceutical professionals, software engineers and machine learning experts based in Berlin. Our vision is to bring just in-time portfolio decision making to pharma today and automate portfolios with AI tomorrow to reduce inefficiencies in the healthcare market and improve patient care.",

At the same time, we still have a lot of care processes which run completely manual and one good example for that is the monitoring and protocoling of patient fluid lines like catheters. This is a very important and frequent process in hospitals and nursing homes. Problem is that currently the process is complex, completely manual which means costly and faulty. We developed a patent filed technology to digitize the whole monitoring process and transform it into a real-time, mobile patient monitoring. We do this with our mobile IoT devices for data collection plus our AI backed software. By implementing our technology an example hospital can save 300.000h nursing time per year. Additionally, the medical doctors and patients benefit from better patient care.<br><br>We are pre-commercial (1Y before EU market entry under MDR) but with a functional prototype (HW &amp; SW) developed at the bedside.

Das System zur effizienten Pflegeanalyse (epaSYSTEM) ist ein datengest\u00fctztes Bewertungssystem f\u00fcr den pflegerelevanten Gesundheitszustand von Menschen aller Altersgruppen Es unterst\u00fctzt die kennzahlenbasierte Entscheidungsfindung, beginnend beim pflegediagnostischen Prozess \u00fcber die Evaluation der pflegerischen Versorgung bis hin zum Management von Einrichtungen des Gesundheitswesens (Krankenh\u00e4user, Pflegeheime etc.). Es ist das Ergebnis eines im Jahr 2002 begonnenen Praxisforschungsprojektes und wird von epaCC weiterentwickelt und vermarktet. <br><br>Die Mission der epaCC lautet: Menschen in Gesundheits- und Pflegeberufen zu bef\u00e4higen, mit richtigen Daten fundierte Entscheidungen zu treffen.<br><br>Die Ergebnisse unserer Arbeit sind als fachlicher Inhalt in die Dokumentationsl\u00f6sungen aller f\u00fchrenden Softwareanbieter integriert. Dabei verbinden unsere (Pflege-)Wissenschaftler:innen evidenzbasierte Forschung und neueste pflegewissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse mit smarten Anwendungsmethoden. Das epaSYSTEM hat sich als der Standard f\u00fcr die Pflegedokumentation im deutschsprachigen Raum etabliert. Derzeit arbeiten \u00fcber 900 Anwenderbetriebe im D-A-CH-LI Raum mit einem oder mehreren Instrumenten des epaSYSTEMS. In Deutschland sind es vor allem die Universit\u00e4tskliniken (&gt;50%) und die kommunalen sowie privaten Gro\u00dfkrankenh\u00e4user, so dass in Deutschland mehr als 50% der Krankenhausbetten abgedeckt sind.<br><br>Die Umsetzung des epaDATENMODELLs in der klinischen Anwendung erfolgt durch die epaINSTRUMENTE (epaAC, epaKIDS, epaPSYC, epaLTC). Diese erm\u00f6glichen Pflegefachpersonen eine systematische Einsch\u00e4tzung des pflegerelevanten Gesundheitszustands von Patienten/Bewohnern anhand von Scores.

This innovative approach allows seniors to access a wide range of digital services, including telemedicine, social connectivity, and entertainment, through the simple act of placing a card on a reader connected to their TV.<br><br>How It Works<br>The Family.cards ecosystem comprises three core components:<br><br>The Set-Top Box (STB): This device runs the Family.cards software and provides connectivity options via WiFi or 4G, making it operational even in households without an internet connection.<br><br>The Card Reader: A wireless, intuitive interface that seniors use to interact with the platform. Each card represents a specific function or service, such as making a video call, viewing family photos, or accessing health-related content.<br><br>The Cards: Durable, easy-to-handle cards that trigger different functions when placed on the card reader. The cards are designed with clear, recognizable symbols and can be personalized for individual users.<br><br>Bridging the Digital Divide<br>Family.cards stands out as a pioneer in the AgeTech sector, offering several key advantages that directly address the barriers to digital inclusion for seniors:<br><br>Intuitive Interaction: The tangible, card-based interaction eliminates the need for navigating complex menus or typing on small touchscreens, making digital services accessible with a simple gesture.<br><br>Customization and Flexibility: The open ecosystem of Family.cards allows for a wide range of services to be added to the platform, from health monitoring to social media, ensuring that the needs and interests of seniors are comprehensively addressed.<br><br>Inclusive Design: The product design takes into consideration various age-related impairments, ensuring that seniors with vision, mobility, or cognitive challenges can use the device confidently.<br><br>Connectivity: By leveraging the familiar interface of the television and offering 4G connectivity, Family.cards ensures that seniors can stay connected with their loved ones and the world, regardless of their tech-savviness or internet access.<br><br>Impact on Health and Well-being<br>The implications of Family.cards for seniors' health and well-being are profound. The platform not only facilitates social connectivity, reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation but also provides easy access to telemedicine services, health information, and wellness programs. This accessibility is particularly crucial in promoting preventive health care, managing chronic conditions, and ensuring timely medical consultations, all from the comfort of one's home.<br><br>Looking Ahead<br>As Family.cards continues to evolve, the vision extends beyond merely providing a digital access point for seniors. The company is actively working on expanding its ecosystem, partnering with health care providers, content creators, and technology firms to enrich the platform with more services and features. The goal is to create a holistic, supportive digital environment that not only enhances the quality of life for seniors but also empowers them to lead active, connected, and fulfilling lives in the digital age.",

We specialize in indoor navigation and asset tracking solutions in challenging environments such as hospitals, care facilities, manufacturing plants, cruise ships and sports stadiums. As a solution provider, our main focus is on service and custom software development. We provide services from consulting and planning of the real-time location system to the installation and roll-out of the infrastructure. In addition, we support you in the maintenance of the productive system and ensure a permanently smooth operation of your RTLS.<br><br>Our RTLS platform is hardware-independent and integrates different positioning technologies as required. This allows you to deploy hybrid location solutions and always use exactly the parameters that your application scenario currently requires. Depending on your needs, you can switch between zone-based and centimeter-based location, for example, and have just one core system in the background.<br><br>We implement indoor navigation and wayfinding systems for patients, visitors and employees in hospitals either via a static digital signage solution or a dynamic blue dot navigation via app. If you already have an existing hospital app, Favendo's real-time navigation can be easily integrated into the app via SDK. The routes or points of interest (PoIs) can be autonomously managed by you and also changed at any time. <br><br>With real-time tracking of equipment, staff or patients, the movements of all hospital-owned assets can be tracked continuously. This saves valuable time not only in emergencies, but also helps you identify and eliminate efficiency problems or digitize entire workflows. With Favendo's medical asset tracking solution, the location data obtained can either be fed directly into existing HIS, CRM or ERP systems or located on the floorplan via a web app. Thus, all hospital operation movement data is centrally bundled in one place.<br><br>Daily hospital operations present many challenges to hospital management. Optimal patient care is in constant competition with cost-efficient staff and resource planning. In addition, it is estimated that hospitals keep 10-20% more mobile devices than are actually required for operations. Only to make sure they can be located quickly when needed. Favendo's goal is to help you address these challenges and improve patient care in hospitals with real-time location. On top of that, with an RTLS, your facility will benefit from increased safety for staff and patients, more time for care, and shorter response times. Optimized processes and more efficient use of resources, as well as the avoidance of unnecessary investments through forward planning, are also among the benefits of an RTLS.",

Documents are transmitted end-to-end and encrypted as PDFs to the recipient's e-mail inbox or information system.

HiGHmed\u2019s medical Data Integration Centers are based on a generic and scalable reference architecture for integrating health data from care, research, and external sources, benefiting all stakeholders in health care, research and society at large. While it is fully interoperable with Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) concepts and solutions for research data sharing, it enables clinical applications and thus a direct translation from research to patient care. Through the clinical use cases we have demonstrated the added value of HiGHmed\u2019s architecture for enhanced care of heart failure patients, improved diagnostics for cancer patients, and for early detection of nosocomial infections. The HiGHmed e.V., as a sustainable organizational body of all participating University Hospitals, will take the lead to explore new opportunities for HiGHmed\u2019s members. HiGHmed\u2019s long-term vision is a wide availability of its open and interoperable platform that fosters data-based, distributed knowledge-building and decision-making processes in patient-centric diagnostics, treatment, medical research and care.",

The work of ID has been methodically developed since then based off the work from Professor Wingert, CEN and GALEN.<br><br>ID software is currently being used in more than 1,200 hospitals throughout Germany, which represents more than 60 per cent nationally, and also in several insurance companies. Furthermore, the multi-lingual coding software ID DIACOS\u00ae is used internationally in many hospitals found in Switzerland, Austria, and China.<br><br>ID co-operates with more than 110 developers of hospital software and is represented in the German federation of manufacturers of IT solutions for the health service (bvitg). Additionally, we are also an authorized partner of the Friedrich Wingert Foundation for the maintenance of the Wingert NC and procedure classification in ICPM including other related software tools.<br><br>ID offers standard software for the coding of diagnoses and procedures in the most diverse classifications, grouper for reimbursement in case fee-based accounting systems (e.g. DRG or LKF), as well as tools for performance analysis and pharmaceutical drug safety.<br><br>A core expertise of the company is the management of medical terminology. The medical semantic network ID MACS\u00ae was developed over many years by dividing medical technical language into individual word components which were then assigned to detailed machine-readable models. Innumerable medical technical texts, text books, articles and findings served as the basis - right now, the net contains an almost complete medical library of vocabulary.<br><br>The ID LOGIK\u00ae terminology server offers services for modeling, controlling, and analyzing process information through the established reference knowledge of ID MACS\u00ae. These functions can be used for context-driven documentation as well as for triggering order entries in clinical applications of other providers. New contents can be attached to defined processes without the need to change the existing data model, since the documentation is based on concept structures. Among these services are text indexing, classification and concept ordering, plausibility checking, and combined reference information.<br><br>ID DIACOS\u00ae differentiates medical facts from different sources: code, text, thesaurus, and graphics. The following classifications, nomenclatures, knowledge bases, and coding guidelines are available within the software systems: ICD-10-GM, ICD-10-SGB V, ICD-10 BMSG, ICD-10 WHO, ICD-9, ICD-9 BMAGS, OPS-301, ICPM 2.0, ICPM, CHOP, AO classification, QUADRA, KIKA, TNM, HV-BG-keys, Weller-keys, German coding rules, Wingert NC and much more. They are accessible within ID MACS\u00ae and available in ID programs.",

By digitally optimising documentation and work processes in hospitals, nursing homes and the home care sector, ilvi GmbH relieves medical staff and ensures future healthcare through process reliability and cost efficiency. <br><br>Hospitals, nursing homes and home care are facing major challenges. The bureaucratic burden is growing and represents a not inconsiderable part of daily working time. The time that once served the care of patients is now additionally needed for the administration of different processes or complex infrastructures with many interfaces. The existing shortage of skilled workers in the nursing profession is becoming more and more apparent. Due to demographic change, there will be an increase in older persons in the coming years/decades and, thus, in need of care.<br>On the other hand, there will be a low birth rate and thus a smaller proportion of younger people who will be trained in the field of care and will be available on the labour market in the future. The shortage of nursing staff, in turn, leads to an overload of existing staff. There is too little time for patients and rest periods. <br><br>It must be our goal to make the profession of nursing more attractive again and to create an environment in which nursing services can be managed in the long term with the available resources while at the same time improving the quality of care, process reliability, data quality and cost efficiency. <br><br>By using our ilviCLINIC solution, the work processes of clinical staff are digitalised and thus optimised. User authentication, patient identification, and the subsequent documentation of vital signs, biometrics, nutrition protocol, import and export, and wound image documentation occur directly at the point of care. Vital data can be automatically transferred from other medical devices and stored directly at the right place in the target system (e.g. in the hospital information system). <br><br>While other mobile solutions focus on themselves and do not access already existing mobile solutions, ilvi's solutions take advantage of technological progress and make it possible to integrate already existing mobile solutions and applications. With a manufacturer-independent platform, we can integrate various mobile medical devices (e.g. blood pressure monitors, oxygen saturation meters, etc.) into our software. ilvi solutions are interoperable with the existing IT infrastructure and in themselves. This makes it possible to send recorded data directly to the desired target system (e.g. hospital information system, nursing documentation). <br><br>Only one mobile device is needed to support a complete mobile workflow.",

        "desc": "MEDICEO is the digital pocket guide for the clinical routine. It is based on a medically classified Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS). We offer doctors, nursing staff, trainees, and medical students easy access to relevant medical information for daily clinical practice, special cases, as well as useful scores and calculators. We are not building the next Wikipedia, but a versatile tool for managing the challenges of clinical routine. Importantly, the basic version of MEDICEO is free for all users and fully functional, even offline.<br><br>(1) BENEFIT FROM THE MEDICEO EFFECT AS A HEALTHCARE FACILITY<br><br>We create an in-house CDSS for you - MEDICEO Enterprise. It consists of your SOPs, procedural instructions, and content developed by us. All content is available on common mobile devices (phones and tablets) as well as station computers. This allows staff to access treatment-relevant information for clinical decision-making at any time and from any location. Does your facility lack comprehensive internet coverage? No problem, MEDICEO works offline.<br><br>You can expect these positive economic effects:<br><br>- Shortened training time<br>- Reduced research effort<br>- Saved recruiting costs<br>- Fewer treatment errors<br>- Improved collaboration<br>- Secured staffing minimums<br><br>(2) THE CORE PROBLEM<br><br>Increasing workload and sluggish digitalization in healthcare lead to high staff turnover and challenges in patient care. Staff lack an adequate means of obtaining information for questions/uncertainties and for effectively training new/young and foreign personnel. If there are digital decision support options, they are often only available on station computers, not usable at the patient\u2019s bedside, not certified, and extremely expensive and time-consuming to acquire and maintain. Moreover, they are often not up-to-date with current scientific standards. There is a lack of effective tools that provide staff with easy access to clinically relevant information that is both up-to-date and clearly presented.<br><br>(3) A SIMPLE CASE EXAMPLE<br><br>Imagine Sophie, a young doctor in her first year of training, faced with a critical case:<br><br>An eight-year-old boy, weighing 38 kg, arrives at the emergency room with urticaria, vomiting, and shortness of breath following a bee sting. Sophie is unsure of what to do and has the following options:<br><br>Ask the senior physician. He is not available, and all other colleagues are absent.<br><br>Sophie is completely alone with her decision.<br><br>Due to her lack of experience, she must conduct research. Immediately, questions arise:<br>- Are there in-house SOPs for this case?<br>- Which information from the confusing guidelines is now relevant?<br>- Is the information verified or up-to-date?<br>- Do the found information need to be adapted? (e.g., dosage calculation)<br><br>This example shows: Information gathering is time-consuming. A tool that can be used not only at the station computer but also at the point of care is essential for effective patient care.<br><br>(4) HOW MEDICEO ENSURES TREATMENT SUCCESS<br><br>1. Speed: Intuitively arrive at the right information thanks to practical presentation.<br>2. Reliability: Direct access to verified, evidence-based medical information with transparent source references.<br>3. Safety: The reliable second opinion in everyday life; security through calculators and intuitive scoring systems.<br><br>MEDICEO bridges the gap between medical theory and easy accessibility through innovative technologies and ideas, aligned with the processes and thought patterns of clinical routine.<br><br>Feel free to drop by spontaneously or book an appointment in advance.

This state-of-the-art self-service platform facilitates comprehensive health check-ups, allowing individuals to access hospital-level measurements independently, anytime and anywhere. The MedicubeX eHealth Station can be placed at any location and allows users to take a full set of hospital-level measurements independently without the presence of a medical professional.<br><br>One of MedicubeX's key objectives is to optimize time and resources for healthcare staff, saving approximately 5-8 minutes per patient encounter. This time-saving feature directly addresses the challenges posed by the nursing shortage, relieving the workload on healthcare professionals and enabling them to focus on more critical tasks. In our current settings, we were able to demonstrate time savings of up to 33% in a walk-in clinic, allowing medical staff to see more patients and focus on more complicated tasks instead of routine and repetitive questionnaires and measurements.<br><br>Another focus is on enhancing preventive healthcare and alleviating the burden on traditional healthcare systems. By enabling autonomous health assessments and immediate remote consultations, we make healthcare more accessible to people and enable personalized care pathways. For preventive care, we shift the focus from reactive to proactive activities through self-service, digitalization, and improved access to information, supporting the acceptance of remote healthcare practices and providing timely interventions.<br><br>MedicubeX is addressing the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Currently in development, our AI-based cardiovascular and diabetes risk index will provide individuals and doctors with measurable results of each individual's risk of developing those diseases.

Fundamental advances in sensor technology and imaging in everyday clinical practice and the private sphere are providing new data. The trans-sectoral networking of healthcare data links episodic data sets to form heterogeneous data sets that will cover the entire lifespan in the medium term. New data analysis technologies for large volumes of data enable new approaches to understanding and treating diseases. This is not simply about the simple use of technologies, but about fundamental changes in healthcare, which will result in more personalised care, new telemedical services and new market participants.<br>Central aspects are the use of new digital methods in care and nursing, evidence- and data-based medicine, the design of health-promoting living environments, smart implants and innovative (bio)sensor technology, personalised medicine and comprehensive care research along the entire care chain. Of particular importance are the focal points of translational medicine, care in rural areas and individualised prevention in the sense of healthy life planning. There is also a need for further development of training and teaching to impart the necessary skills.<br>At the Zukunftslabor Gesundheit stand, you can experience the work of the Zukunftslabor and its partners.

Approximately 3,000 employees in various opta data group companies work on software, customized financial services, and services for healthcare professionals, providing providers with leeway for their core activities.<br><br>Our customers include, among others, nursing services, therapy providers, medical device suppliers, ambulance services, taxi/rental car companies, rehabilitation facilities, midwives, social welfare organizations, doctors, and hospitals. However, customers outside the healthcare sector also benefit from the opta data group's portfolio, such as independent financing, digital communication products, or targeted telephone marketing.<br><br>The foundation of our success is the trust of our customers, competent and dedicated employees, and decades of expertise in the healthcare market. As market experts, we actively shape the digitization of the healthcare sector and support various actors in the healthcare sector in realizing their plans. This commitment has made us experts in the field of telematics infrastructure.<br><br>Interoperability as a solution approach and what the opta data group can contribute<br><br>Digitization appears to be the answer to the question of how we can improve our healthcare system and initiate progress that offers valuable added value. But how exactly is this supposed to work, especially in an industry that is characterized by analog processes? Not only doctors, clinics, and pharmacies should be able to participate in digitization. All other healthcare providers must also be included. How can this be achieved? The answer lies in interoperability, that is, the meaningful networking between different computer systems. And that's exactly what the telematics infrastructure does! What initially sounds cumbersome offers the entire industry and patients significant benefits because the telematics infrastructure (TI) connects all sectors and areas of the healthcare sector. The TI serves as a kind of high-speed highway that connects doctors, clinics, pharmacies, as well as all service providers such as nursing companies, therapy and medical device providers, and midwives with each other and ensures a fast, secure exchange of highly sensitive data.<br><br>As a digitization expert, we always drive change and innovation forward. In addition to other participants, the opta data group is involved in pilot projects that deal with, among other things, the design of future processes for an electronic prescription (ePrescription) and actively shapes them. By the way, you can experience the digital prescription process live at our booth - come by and redeem an ePrescription issued by our partner and receive a great aid for it! (Hall 1.2; Booth D-107)",

        "desc": "At pheal, we stand for the transformation of the healthcare system - from \"sick-care\u201d to prevention of critical health events. To prevent these events, doctors need a comprehensive picture of the patient \u2013 ideally at every time, and in a remote fashion.<br>We implement this by using multiparametric biosensor technology in a wearable smart patch to continuously monitor central blood biomarkers, currently focusing on heart failure (HF).<br>More than 64 million people worldwide are affected by heart failure - and the numbers are rising. <br>HF is characterized by bouts of hemodynamic deterioration- the normal blood flow and pressure are disrupted, typically due to the heart's inability to pump blood effectively. The resulting status of cardiac decompensation leads to frequent hospitalizations and a high mortality rate, reaching 65% at 5 years post-diagnosis. What is more, HF symptoms constantly and rapidly decrease the patient\u2019s quality of life and perception of control over their own condition. <br>Despite advancements in therapy, mortality remains high, and the burden on healthcare, in terms of costs and healthcare professional (HCP) workload, is substantial. Traditional monitoring methods often fail to capture early signs of deterioration, necessitating effective strategies to reduce (re-)admissions and enhance ambulatory care. Given that the earliest detectable changes in physiological measurements occur prior to the onset of symptoms, timely detection of impending crisis is crucial to avoid hospitalization and premature death. <br>Recently, remote monitoring options have been implemented in the patient journey. Current diagnosis and treatment guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology consider self-care as essential for effective management of HF and recommend patient self-management strategies to reduce the risk of hospitalization and mortality. <br>Traditional approaches to monitoring HF patients include frequent weight monitoring, blood pressure measurements, Holter monitoring, or symptom assessments using structured telephone encounters or telemonitoring-based platforms. However, these methods are time and resource-intensive for both patients and providers. Additionally, these parameters often represent later changes in the path of decompensation. To allow for early indication of a critical health change, it is essential to monitor molecular pathways that drive cardiac decompensation.<br>The pheal Smart Patch Heart Failure aims to close this gap. The sensor-based wearable medical device for continuous real-time monitoring of HF patients fasciliates remote patient assessment through telemedicine. The product consists of a disposable patch, a reusable patch and a smartphone app, linked to a telemedicine centre.<br>The disposable patch includes the multiparametric sensors, incorporated into a flexible and skin-friendly foam material. The product uses an innovative, patented approach to access the capillary blood named \"window into your body\", in which a small scratch is applied to the patient's skin and covered by a biomimetic membrane. This membrane mimics the intact skin and allows for continuous analysis of blood parameters measured by the sensors. <br>The smart patch, worn continuously by patients, requires minimal patient intervention. After being applied by the patient, the smart patch continuously monitors the essential blood values automatically. <br>Combined with AI based data interpretation algorithms, data measured via the sensors allow for early detection of critical health changes. As soon as the algorithm identifies a trend for deterioration in the patient\u2019s condition via the measured values, the patient as well as the telemedicine centre chosen for remote monitoring are informed. Treatment can be induced immediately and without delay, preventing a further deterioration of the patient\u2019s health condition. As a result, cardiac decompensation and, hence, unnecessary hospitalizations, are prevented.",

There is no time for proper training of new team members, weaknesses remain undiscovered, and quality suffers. In the midst of this negative spiral, even the best employees eventually leave the team, knowledge is lost, and the cycle continues to intensify.<br><br>This spiral must be broken. With RiQS, we have developed an app that does just that. Our system has been developed from day one in our practices, establishing four principles:<br><br>1) (Senior) doctors are not burdened. RiQS manages workflows, checks, and processes around the doctors, ensuring they always find orderly treatment rooms and can devote their time to the patients.<br><br>2) Specialist management runs the system. <br>As a hub where the work of medical assistants converges, management receives new information on a wide range of topics every day. As a result, managers are often overwhelmed by the amount of topics they have to deal with on a daily basis. This is where RiQS comes to the rescue and ensures that all relevant tasks are always correctly prioritized and implemented. RiQS provides an insight into the ongoing processes at all times, without a report from the base, so that checking completed work is no longer a burden.<br><br>3) Operational business must not be disrupted. <br>A functioning day-to-day operation is the core of any medical facility and must not be disturbed under any circumstances. Therefore, RiQS is designed in all modules to support its users and never be perceived as an additional administrative burden.<br><br>4) The use must provide noticeable relief. <br>For an app, especially one used at the base, to truly become a part of everyday life, its use must noticeably relieve every user. In addition to the specific support of individual modules, RiQS achieves this acceptance especially through a particularly user-friendly interface, making it usable even for digitally inexperienced employees.<br><br>Taking these principles into account, RiQS organizes the daily work routine and thus automates the documentation of processes, workflows, and checks. This creates a digital window into day-to-day operations. We use this window to combine further elements such as document maintenance and control, risk and quality management, process and equipment management, or task assignment in one place and integrate them into everyday life with minimal effort.<br><br>Visit us at booth B-109 in Hall 2.2 to get to know RiQS better and try out its modules yourself.
